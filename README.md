## Introduction
This is final project of operating system course. In this project we shuold modify xv6 operating system's source code and add some system calls and add some scheduling algorithms and write some tests and other modifications.<br>

Add system call: We sould add three system calls. First, we should wirte a system call named getParentID which is responsible for getting number of parent process of the current process. Second, we should add getChildren system call which should get process id's of children of the current process. Third, we should add getSyscallCounter which should tell us how many times we have called a system call at the current process.<br>

Add scheduling algorithms: We should add three scheduling algorithms: Round-Robin, Priority Scheduling, multilevel queue scheduling algorithms.<br>

Write tests: we should write some tests to verify correctness of changes we made.
